# End-to-End Projects (Deep Learning & Machine Learning)

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end Machine Learning, Deep Learning and MLOps projects created for learning, practice and real-world style implementation.

Each project follows a complete pipeline starting from data processing to model training, evaluation and deployment-ready structure.
